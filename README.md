**Project Title:  
FaceFrenzy - Hilarious Facial Expression Games**

---

**Project Overview:**

FaceFrenzy is a fun and interactive web app where players use their facial expressions to control characters and complete silly challenges. The app employs facial recognition technology to detect and respond to facial movements, creating a lighthearted gaming experience. Through various mini-games, players engage in challenges like racing a character with a smile or jumping by blinking, all controlled by their face. Perfect for parties or personal fun, this web app brings joy and laughter to users in an innovative way.

**Why This Project:**

FaceFrenzy provides a unique opportunity to create a web app that blends humor and technology. By using facial recognition and AR directly in the browser, this project challenges me to work with new, exciting technologies like webcam-based facial detection, real-time interaction, and AR integration, all with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, it's a lighthearted and innovative project that can bring a smile to anyone who plays, making it both fun and fulfilling to build.
