**Why This Project:**  
I chose this project because it combines humor, technology, and social interaction in a way thatâ€™s both fun and innovative. Facial expression-based games are not only entertaining but also encourage players to be expressive and creative. By working on FaceFrenzy, I will develop skills in mobile app development, facial recognition technology, AR integration, and real-time multiplayer functionality. Additionally, the project offers an opportunity to explore user experience (UX) design for maximum engagement and laughter. This project is not only technically challenging but also has the potential to bring joy to users, making it both exciting and meaningful.
